# Knockout Material Components

Knockout Material Components (MDC-Knockout) help Knockout developers execute
[Material Design](https://www.material.io/).
This project is built on top of the Google's
[MDC-Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
components and allows to use them on the Knockout enabled websites in
a pretty, concise manner.

There are two different ways to use Knockout Material Components:
- HTML-only, when Knockout is used only to generate MDC-Web compatible HTML
structure
- Fully featured, when Knockout bindings are used to link data to the UI

Either way, the development will be faster (as required HTML is shorter)
and free of error-prone copy pasting. Besides, the bindings are not limited
to only the standard ones, so it's easy to plug these components in any
existing project.
